# Data-Cleaning
This repository is related to House Price Prediction project where I demonstrate how to clean scrapped data using Python Pandas. 
It is also part of our online learning assessment.


Before we start, we need to identify the scope of data cleaning by screening through the data.
In summary, we have 6 items to be completed in this data cleaning exercise.
1. Strip the blank space in front of the values
2. Delete unused columns in analysis such as index column and link used in data scraping
3. Replace blank with NaN for numerical columns and NA for categorical columns
4. Convert acres into square feet to ensure consistent UOM is used
5. Remove all units such as "RM", "sq. ft","Bedrooms", "Bathrooms" and "Acres"
6. Convert data type accordingly (int, float, str)
